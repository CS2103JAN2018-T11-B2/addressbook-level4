<p>Prisonbook is a desktop address book application used for Prison Guards/Inmates management.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Allowing users to manage the prison cells.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: There is a cell map that has a fixed size and certain number of cells.
It allows guards and prison wardens to add prisoners to cells and to remove them.
It also allows guards and prison wardens to view a list of prisoners in a specified cell to help them do the previously mentioned features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This helps to keep track of prisoners and their locations and to take into consideration prisoner combinations
when adding and removing them from cells.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Map of prison cells on GUI. It hides information on GUI before logging in and after logging out.
It will also show the list of persons in PrisonBook and people in the map when logged in successfully.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Justification: This helps to boost security for the application, by preventing users who have insufficient security level to view classified information.</p>

<h4 id="current-implementation"><a class="link" href="#current-implementation">Current Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a prison, it is necessary to have cells where prisoners stay in.
It is important to keep track of the prisoners in the cell and whether the <code>Cell</code> is full.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This cell system is most clearly represented using a 2-D array.
Hence, this was used as the basis of the map system of the prison.
However, to prevent accidental changes, a read-only version of the cells are returned in an <code>ObservableList</code>.
Since this is part of the <code>Model</code> component of the PrisonBook, the <code>Model</code> component has been updated accordingly as shown below.
At the bottom of the <code>Model</code> class diagram, it has been updated to show how the cell system is linked to the other components.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/ModelClassDiagramwSessionwCells.png" alt="ModelClassDiagramwSessionwCells">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To save and load the data of the cell system, storage also played an important component to ensure no data is lost when closing the app.
Below is a class diagram of <code>Storage</code> to show how the cells are saved. A new type is added to the storage so that it knows how to save and load data for cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/StorageClassDiagramwUserwCells.png" alt="StorageClassDiagramwUserwCells">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This map is shown on the user interface on the right side area, shown in the picture below.
Since the app is still being tested, the <code>map</code> command will also show the actual cells in the result display box.
This basic map shows the cell system and helps keep track of what is happening in the cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/MapPanel.png" alt="MapPanel" width="550">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This cell system helps users visualise the locations of the prisoners more easily. Not only that, prisoners can also be added and removed from them.
These changes can be viewed in the bigger map which displays the number of people in individual cells below each cell address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming the user has access to the functions to add prisoners into prison cells, they can use the <code>addcell</code> command to do so.
Below is the sequence diagram of the logic and model components.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<img src="../images/AddCellModelSequenceDiagram.PNG" alt="AddCellModelSequenceDiagram" width="550">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides the cell map system being updated, we will also update the addresses of these prisoners added to the prison, since they now live in the prison, rather than in their own homes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Prisoners can also be removed from their cells using the <code>deletecell</code> command when they are being transferred to another cell,
or if they can leave prison and go back home to their loved ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To aid in adding prisoners to cells and deleting them from the cells, a <code>listcell</code> command has been implemented.
With this command, users can see who are in a specified cell. This helps users know whether the cell is full and
if some of these prisoners should not be added to the same cell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For future implementations, we can also allow only the prison wardens/owners to redefine the maximum size of the prison as their prisons
may grow or shrink in the future. In this application, we will only show an example with 15 cells with a maximum of 2 prisoners per cell.
These values can be easily changed and we will customise it based on your needs. The naming of the cells can also be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<ul>

<p>Pros: Easy to visualise the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Harder to do more functions that the Java API has provided. Does not fit in with the other models of Person and Tag and their internalList.
It also makes it harder to implement undo and redo functions for actions below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use a 2-level ArrayList</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Can use Java functions meant for Lists, can have different number of units for each block</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Cells are always there and can hold prisoners. Since persons in the PrisonBook can be either prisoners or guards, not all persons may have a cell.
Easier to delete prisoners from cells and update their addresses accordingly when they are released from prison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Need to have extra implementation to ensure undo and redo commands work properly when deleting a prisoner who is imprisoned as well
as to remove them or add them to cells.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Not have a cell map but to add cells to prisoners.</p>

<p>Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user, to check a prisoner&#8217;s cell location.</p>

<p>Pros: Faster way to remove since only the index of the prisoner is required. User does not have to figure out which cell the prisoner he or she is in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Since cells have a size limit of 2, it is easier to delete a person after selecting a cell.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Choosing a cell and the person to delete from the cell after seeing the list.</p>

<p>Pros: Easier to choose a cell when there are many people in the PrisonBook and is difficult to see who the prisoners are.</p>

<li>
<p>Cons: Requires more steps to delete a person from the cell, by having to first list then delete.
Current implementation can work in a similar way that makes it easier to delete a prisoner from a cell.</p>

<li>
<p>Major enhancement:<br>
Creating a cell system of all the prison cells in the prison.
This helps users add and remove prisoners to their prison and prevent users from overcrowding their prison.
It can also help users keep track of locations of the cells of each prisoner.
Users can also add and remove prisoners more easily by first listing people in each cell to decide where to add or remove them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor enhancement:<br>
Show map of the cell system on the UI.
Also implemented the UI to show the list of persons and the map when first logged in
